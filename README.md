# museum_wellbeing_survey
Overview: The Wellbeing Survey Application is designed to collect, analyze, and visualize survey data related to participants' wellbeing experiences in the museum. It leverages sentiment analysis to gauge the tone of user comments and visualizes survey responses using Likert scale plot, sentiment plot, and an artistic visualization in the form of a digital kaleidoscope. This application is useful for museum organizations looking to collect and analyze survey data related to wellbeing, providing both qualitative and quantitative insights into participants' experiences.
